And our pediatrician kind of pulled me aside and said you might want to look at your children's diet. And up until that point I thought I was good. I was doing, you know, I was pretty conscientious. We always worked out. But he was starting to see some trends that he didn't like and he was a doctor working primarily in the inner city. And he shared with me what he was seeing in his practice - the increase of type 2 diabetes among his young patients, a higher incidence of obesity.

Fewer schools are offering PE. Only two percent of high schools, public high schools, in the country offer PE classes - two percent. So, slowly, our habits have changed to the point where it's jeopardizing the health of our children. And what I suspected was that most people were like me - they weren't paying attention and they weren't trying to do the wrong thing. They just didn't know. So, the hope when I came in, was that we could start a conversation about kid's health\",\n",

But a couple of recent studies just out in these last weeks, and one financed - with financing from the National Institutes of Health have cast some doubt on this idea of food desert. I mean, they found lots of fast food places, but also supermarkets and produce stands in numbers that people really were thinking weren't there, I mean, as many as you might find in a middle-class area, sometimes more, and no link to obesity\",\n",

You know, people are living in areas - there are areas near my home in Chicago where you have to get on a bus or take a cab. You know, obviously, if you're in the city of Chicago, there are grocery stores in the city of Chicago. But if you're a mother with five small kids and you're on a fixed income, the notion that every other day you're going to get on a bus or take a cab to a supermarket that's maybe five miles away but you're carrying groceries and it's awkward and it's hard to do, that doesn't seem like the kind of accessibility that many more fortunate communities have\",\n",
