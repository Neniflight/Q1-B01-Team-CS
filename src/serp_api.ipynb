If inflationary pressures increase, the Federal Reserve might need to keep its benchmark interest rates higher.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nTrump\\'s threats come as arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico have been falling. The most recent U.S. numbers for October show arrests remain near four-year lows, with U.S. Border Patrol making 56,530 arrests in October, less than one third of the tally from October last year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, arrests for illegally crossing the border from Canada have been rising over the past two years. The Border Patrol made 23,721 arrests between October 2023 and September 2024, compared with 10,021 the previous 12 months. More than 14,000 of those arrested on the Canadian border were Indian — more than 10 times the number two years ago.\\n\\nLast week, a jury convicted two men on charges related to human smuggling for their roles in an international operation that led to the deaths of a family of Indian migrants who froze while trying to cross the Canada-U.S. border during a 2022 blizzard.\\n\\nMuch of America’s fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nIf Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular.\\n\\nThe Canadian dollar weakened sharply in foreign exchange markets immediately following Trump’s post.\\n\\nDuring Trump’s first term, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the Canadian auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\\n\\nThe tariffs would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump with Canada and Mexico, the USMCA, which replaced NAFTA and is up for review in 2026.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nIt’s unclear from Trump’s social media post how he would legally apply tariff hikes on those two pivotal U.S. trade partners, but the 2020 deal allows for national security exceptions.\\n\\nTrump transition team officials did not immediately respond to questions about what authority he would use, what he would need to see to prevent the tariffs from being implemented and how they would impact prices in the U.S.\\n\\nWhen Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.\\n\\nMany of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThe Canadian government, in a joint statement from Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc, emphasized the close relationship between the two countries and said they will discuss the border and vast economic ties with the incoming administration.\\n\\n“Canada places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of our shared border. Our relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for American workers,” the statement read.\\n\\nFreeland, who chairs a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address concerns about another Trump presidency, has said the president-elect\\'s promise to launch a mass deportation and concern that that could lead to an influx of migrants to Canada, is a top focus of the committee.\\n\\nA second senior Canadian official had said before Trump\\'s posts that Canadian officials were expecting him to issue executive orders on trade and the border as soon as he assumes office. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nMexico’s Foreign Relations Department and Economy Department also had no immediate reaction to Trump’s statements. Normally such weighty issues are handled by the president at her morning press briefings.\\n\\nLast week, a senior Chinese commerce official said higher tariffs on Chinese exports would backfire by raising prices for consumers. Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen also said China can manage the impact of such “external shocks.\"\\n\\n___ Gillies reported from Toronto.

When he talked to economists, they, generally speaking, hate tariffs because that imposes an extra kind of friction on trade. But it does seem very likely that when he comes into the White House, he\\'s going to impose them. When you take a step back here, he does not like the fact that the US has a massive trade deficit - it imports far more stuff, physical stuff, than it exports. He feels that\\'s a failure. And China has this enormous trade surplus - China exports a lot more than it imports. So does Germany, and so does Europe as a whole. We in the UK have the same problem as America. It raises big questions about the nature of the global economy, about whether the manufacturing base in the US is healthy, whether it could be better. But I think a lot of people are very nervous about the potential economic impact of this because, and I think part of the nervousness is, they look back at the 1930s. That was the last time you had nations around the world raising tariffs, raising tariffs, raising taxes, all these barriers to trade. And that was to some extent the economic spiral that contributed towards the Second World War. So they look at that, and they say: \"We do not want to do that again\". And they hear Donald Trump say the word \"tariffs\" in an approving term, and they are horrified by it. But the reality is he\\'s speaking about a global economic system that isn\\'t particularly working well either. And so I think it\\'s an interesting intellectual moment, but it\\'s also quite unnerving. You\\'ve got this moment where you\\'ve got war in Europe, you\\'ve got nervousness about the energy transition. You\\'ve got tensions around the world between the US and China.
